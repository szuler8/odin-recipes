        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This delicious Korean beef bowl is quick and easy to make with ground beef. It's seasoned with fresh ginger, garlic, soy, sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper, but these ingredients can easily be adjusted to suit your taste. Serve over warm rice or spiralized vegetables.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>⅓ cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red peppe</li>
            <li>6 green onions, chopped, divided</li>
            <li>4 cups hot cooked brown rice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, stirring and crumbling into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Stir in garlic, ginger, and sesame oil and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper. Cook until beef absorbs some sauce, about 7 minutes. Add 1/2 of chopped green onions.</li>
            <li>Serve over hot cooked rice; garnish with sesame seeds and remaining green onions.</li>
        </ol>
